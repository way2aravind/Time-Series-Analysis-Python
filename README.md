## Introduction
Time series analysis is crucial for understanding data that varies over time, helping us uncover patterns and make forecasts. In this project, we use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `statsmodels` to perform time series analysis on a dataset of monthly airline passengers.

## Objectives
- Understand the components of time series data.
- Visualize time-indexed data to identify trends and seasonality.
- Decompose a time series to analyze its underlying structure.

## Setup and Requirements
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`

Install the libraries via pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
